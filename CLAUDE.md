# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Structure

This is a personal finance management application with two main components:

- **financas-api**: Node.js/Express backend API with PostgreSQL database using Prisma ORM
- **financas-app**: React Native mobile application built with Expo

## Development Commands

### Backend API (financas-api)

```bash
cd financas-api
npm run dev          # Start development server with nodemon
npm install          # Install dependencies
npx prisma generate  # Generate Prisma client
npx prisma db push   # Push schema changes to database
npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration_name>  # Create and apply new migration
npx prisma studio    # Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)
```

### Mobile App (financas-app)

```bash
cd financas-app
npm start            # Start Expo development server
npm run android      # Start on Android device/emulator
npm run ios          # Start on iOS device/simulator
npm run web          # Start web version
npm install          # Install dependencies
```

### Database Setup

```bash
cd financas-api
docker-compose up -d  # Start PostgreSQL database container
```

## Architecture Overview

### Backend Structure

- **Server**: Express.js server in `server.js` with route mounting
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with bcryptjs for password hashing
- **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints for users, transactions, categories, debtors, and debts
- **Controllers**: Business logic separated into controller files
- **Middleware**: Authentication middleware for protected routes

### Database Schema

Core entities managed by Prisma:

- **User**: Main user entity with email/password authentication
- **Transaction**: Financial transactions (RECEITA/DESPESA) with amounts and categories
- **Category**: User-specific transaction categories with optional colors
- **Debtor**: People who owe money
- **Debt**: Debt records with due dates and total amounts
- **Payment**: Individual payments made towards debts

### Mobile App Structure

- **Navigation**: React Navigation v7 with stack and tab navigators
- **State Management**: React Context for authentication
- **Styling**: Custom styled-components with TypeScript
- **API Integration**: Axios for HTTP requests with centralized configuration
- **Fonts**: Roboto font family loaded via Expo Google Fonts

### Key Features

- User registration and JWT authentication
- Income and expense transaction tracking
- Transaction categorization with custom categories
- Debt management system with payment tracking
- Mobile-first design with React Native

## Database Connection

The API connects to PostgreSQL using the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. The Docker Compose setup provides a local PostgreSQL instance on port 5432.

## Environment Variables

- **Backend**: Requires `DATABASE_URL`, `PORT`, and `JWT_SECRET` in `.env`
- **Mobile**: Uses react-native-dotenv for environment configuration

## TypeScript Configuration

The mobile app uses TypeScript with:

- Path aliases: `@/*` maps to `src/*`
- Strict mode enabled
- Expo TypeScript base configuration

## Code Style Guidelines

- **Language**: All comments in code should be written in Portuguese (Brazil)
- **Comments**: Use Portuguese for inline comments, function descriptions, and documentation
- **Variable/Function Names**: Keep in English following standard conventions
- **Error Messages**: User-facing messages should be in Portuguese

## Development Workflow Rules

### CRITICAL: Session Management and Git Workflow

**Claude MUST follow these rules for every session:**

1. **üìù Document All Changes**: Always update this CLAUDE.md file with:
   - Session summary with accomplishments and technical changes
   - Key files modified with specific changes
   - Git commit references and deployment status
   - User experience improvements and performance optimizations

2. **üíæ End-of-Session Git Workflow**: 
   - **ALWAYS commit and push changes** at the end of each session
   - **Monitor token usage** and initiate commit process when approaching limits
   - Create descriptive commit messages following the established patterns
   - Update Recent Development History section with current session details

3. **‚ö†Ô∏è Token Limit Management**:
   - **Stop all work immediately** when token usage approaches 80% of daily limit
   - **Prioritize documentation update** and git commit process
   - **Ask user for confirmation** before proceeding with git operations
   - **Never leave uncommitted changes** at session end

4. **üîÑ Commit Process Protocol**:
   ```bash
   # 1. Check git status and add changes
   git status
   git add .
   
   # 2. Create descriptive commit with session summary
   git commit -m "feat: [Session Summary] - [Key accomplishments]
   
   ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
   
   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   
   # 3. Push to remote repository
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **üìã Session Documentation Template**:
   ```markdown
   ### Session: YYYY-MM-DD - [Session Title]
   
   **Major Accomplishments:**
   - ‚úÖ **Task N**: [Description]

   **Performance/UX Improvements:**
   - [User-facing improvements]
   ```

### CRITICAL: Always Test Before Editing

**Before making ANY changes to the codebase, Claude MUST:**

1. **Start the API server** and verify it's running without errors:

   ```bash
   cd financas-api
   npm run dev
   ```

   - Check that server starts on port 3000
   - Verify database connection is working
   - Ensure no compilation or runtime errors

2. **Start the mobile app** and verify it loads properly:

   ```bash
   cd financas-app
   npm start
   ```

   - Check that Expo dev server starts successfully
   - Verify no TypeScript compilation errors
   - Test that app loads without crashes

3. **Test existing functionality** that will be affected by proposed changes:

   - Navigate through relevant screens
   - Test API calls and data loading
   - Verify authentication flows work
   - Check that existing features function correctly

4. **Only after confirming the app works properly**, proceed with planned changes

### Error Prevention Protocol

- **Never submit code changes** without first verifying the application runs successfully
- **Always test modified functionality** after making changes
- **Run TypeScript compilation** to catch type errors: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- **Check for runtime errors** in both browser console and terminal output
- **Verify API endpoints** are accessible and returning expected data

**Failure to follow this testing protocol will result in broken submissions that frustrate the user.**

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### API Connection Issues (Mobile Device)

If the mobile app cannot connect to the API:

1. **Check Docker Database**: Ensure Docker Desktop is running and PostgreSQL container is up

   ```bash
   docker ps  # Should show financas_db_container running
   cd financas-api && docker-compose up -d  # Start database if needed
   ```

2. **Verify Server Binding**: Server must bind to all interfaces, not just localhost

   - Server should listen on `0.0.0.0:3000` not just `localhost:3000`
   - Check `server.js` for `app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', ...)`

3. **CORS Configuration**: Ensure CORS allows the correct Expo ports

   - Default: port 8081
   - Alternative: port 8082 (if 8081 is busy)
   - Update CORS origins in `server.js` to include both ports

4. **Network Connectivity**: Device and development machine must be on same WiFi network

   - API URL in `.env` should use machine's local IP (e.g., `http://192.168.0.24:3000/api`)
   - Test connectivity: `curl http://<machine-ip>:3000/api/users/login`

## Handling INSTRUCTIONS.MD

When an `INSTRUCTIONS.MD` file is present in the root of the project, it should be treated as a set of tasks to be executed. The following workflow should be followed:

1. Read the `INSTRUCTIONS.MD` file to understand the tasks.
2. Execute the tasks one by one, asking for validation from the user after each task is completed.
3. Once all tasks are completed and validated, clear the content of the `INSTRUCTIONS.MD` file, leaving only the structure.
